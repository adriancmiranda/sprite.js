What __sprite.js__ does, cannot be done faster.\r\nThat being said, animating the element background is not the fastest possible way how to do this kind of animations (canvas solutions are faster), but it is sure as hell the most simple one, and compatible with everything from IE6 and up.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n__sprite.js__ has no dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nWorks everywhere.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is centralized in the _[gh-page](http://adriancmiranda.github.io/sprite.js)_, which makes it way easier to maintain and keep always up to date. _Only available in Portuguese yet, but there is an of examples collection available [here](https://github.com/adriancmiranda/sprite.js/tree/master/examples)._\r\n\r\n## How to install __sprite.js__ in your project\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbower install --save-dev adriancmiranda/sprite.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to build your own __sprite.js__\r\n\r\nClone a copy of the main __sprite.js__ git repo by running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:adriancmiranda/sprite.js.git && cd sprite.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the build script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe built version of __sprite.js__ will be put in the `dist/` subdirectory, along with the minified copy and associated map file.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[MIT](https://github.com/adriancmiranda/generator-gulp-requirejs/blob/master/LICENSE \"MIT LICENSE\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
